Some of the content featured on my Digital Humanities website: roisinod.com. Most of the code is tailored towards Wordpress i.e the buttons appear differently running HTML through local host and using Wordpress.
A lot of the code uses features built into Wordpress. It was fun and useful to develop a HTML project for my everyday use.
